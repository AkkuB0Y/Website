## Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Portfolio Website, where I creatively display my organizations and qualifications. For some extra features, I've also included links to my socials, where I post my musical content.

In order to create this website, I used React and Next.js as the base frameworks, and built on top of it with an array of UI/UX tools, such as Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and Framer Motion. I also made it responsive, for your viewing pleasure on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile :)
